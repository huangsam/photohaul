# Configuration User Guide

Edit `config.properties` as you see fit. This is the default configuration file
for the Photohaul application. Use any of the `*-example.properties` files for
personal reference.

One helpful tip is to keep copies of existing configuration in the `personal` subfolder .
That way, you do not have to run `git stash` on the repository to avoid committing
private settings unintentionally.
